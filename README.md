About Me

I am currently taking a course through CircuitStream, endorsed by The University of British Columbia, to learn Unity and C#. My goal is to break into the gaming industry and share my passion for creating engaging and immersive experiences.

I enjoy developing 3rd person games, survival games, first-person games, and platformers, and I aim to combine elements of exploration, combat, and storytelling in my projects. My portfolio will showcase games Iâ€™ve worked on during my course, as well as personal creations that highlight my skills and creativity.

Iâ€™m excited to bring my ideas to life and contribute to the world of gaming.
