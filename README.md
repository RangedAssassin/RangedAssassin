About Me

I am a happily married father of two wonderful girls and have been passionate about video games since I was 5 years old, starting with my first Atari system. For over two decades, Iâ€™ve worked in warehousing and retail, but Iâ€™m now pursuing a career in the gaming industry to align my profession with my lifelong passion.

I am currently taking a course through CircuitStream, endorsed by The University of British Columbia, to learn Unity and C#. My focus is on developing 3rd person games, survival games, first-person games, and platformers, blending exploration, combat, and storytelling.

I am actively seeking full-time remote work in the gaming industry, where I can bring my creativity and skills to life. Through this journey, I aim to create immersive experiences and showcase my work through a portfolio of course projects and personal creations. Iâ€™m excited to make a meaningful impact in the gaming world.
